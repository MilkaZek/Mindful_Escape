# mindful-escape-beta-copy

## Welcome to Mindful Escape!!
- In this repository you can find the code for this mindfulness web-app that my group and I developed for our final project in LMU CSSI the summer before our first year in college
- We have different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each of the various stress pages and functions of our website in the repository
- Here is the link to see our functioning site that came out of this code! https://mindful-escape-beta.cb-0090.repl.co
