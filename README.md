# Mindful Escape

## Welcome to Mindful Escape!!
- In this repository you can find the code for a mindfulness web-app that my group and I developed for our final project in LMU CSSI the summer before our first year in college
- We have different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each of the various stress pages and functions of our website in the repository

## What is Mindful Escape?
- This is a web-app where users can take a quiz that helps them identify what types of stress they are experiencing, then get connected to resources to help them combat that stress.
- Each 'stress page' includes facts and links to outside sources about that type of stress and may include a fun implementation of an API to help improve a user's day :) (from random jokes to pictures of relatable cats!)

**Note**: This site was originally developed on Replit as a final project during LMU's CSSI program but now runs on GitHub. Here is the link to use the site!

**Note**: This was a group effort, so thank you to my fellow coders Amelie, Cara, Addy, Mannya, and Vanessa who you can learn more about on the "About Us" page of our website!
